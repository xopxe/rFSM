---
--- Simple example to illustrate the await plugin.
--
-- In a nutshell, this plugin permits to trigger transitions only
-- after multiple events have been received. These events can be
-- received in different steps.
--
-- This is basically a specialized version of the emem plugin. This
-- one should be preferred if no counting is required, since it is
-- computationally much less expensive.
--
-- Behavior:
-- When loaded, the plugin scans for events with the syntax
-- await(event1, event2)". This statement is transformed as follows:
--
--  - a guard condition is generated and added to possibly existing
--    guard conditions. It will only enable the transition if the both
--    events have been received while the source state is active.
--
--  - a second hook is installed in the exit function of the source
--    state to reset the event counting. So when the source state is
--    exited (either via or not via the await transition) and
--    reentered again, the counting start from the beginning. It would
--    be trivial to provide a variant of await that resets the counts
--    only if the await transition is taken, however it is not clear
--    to me right now if that would be useful at all.
